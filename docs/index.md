# FRC 6399: Introduction to FIRST Robotics Competition

## **Course Description**

This project-based course guides students through the full development of a competitive FRC robot, covering mechanical design, electrical systems, and command-based programming. From chassis construction to sensor integration and autonomous control, students gain hands-on experience in CAD, fabrication, wiring, and Java programming using WPILib. The course culminates in a final project where all subsystems are integrated into a fully functional robot, emphasizing teamwork, problem-solving, and engineering best practices.

## **Learning Objectives**

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Explain the principles and requirements of the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) and apply engineering teamwork and project management practices within a student robotics team.
- Design and prototype mechanical subsystems (e.g., drivetrains, elevators, intakes) using CAD tools, considering structural integrity, motion, and manufacturability.
- Select appropriate materials and manufacturing methods (e.g., 3D printing, CNC, hand tools) based on functional and mechanical requirements.
- Assemble and wire FRC electrical systems, including power distribution, motor controllers, sensors, and communication networks (e.g., CAN Bus), following safety and competition standards.
- Demonstrate practical skills in soldering, circuit debugging, and integration of electronic components into a cohesive control system.
- Program robot behaviors in Java using the WPILib command-based framework, including motor control, sensor feedback, and PID control for autonomous and teleoperated operation.
- Integrate mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems into a fully functional robot through collaborative, project-based implementation and iterative testing.
