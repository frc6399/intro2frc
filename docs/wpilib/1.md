# 1. Time-Based Programming

First, here is what a simple code can look like for a Drivetrain with PWM controlled motors (such as SparkMax).

package edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.examples.gettingstarted;

import edu.wpi.first.util.sendable.SendableRegistry;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.Timer;

 */
public class Robot extends TimedRobot {
  private final PWMSparkMax m_leftDrive = new PWMSparkMax(0);
  private final PWMSparkMax m_rightDrive = new PWMSparkMax(1);
  private final DifferentialDrive m_robotDrive =
      new DifferentialDrive(m_leftDrive::set, m_rightDrive::set);
  private final XboxController m_controller = new XboxController(0);
  private final Timer m_timer = new Timer();

  /** Called once at the beginning of the robot program. */
  public Robot() {
    SendableRegistry.addChild(m_robotDrive, m_leftDrive);
    SendableRegistry.addChild(m_robotDrive, m_rightDrive);

    // We need to invert one side of the drivetrain so that positive voltages
    // result in both sides moving forward. Depending on how your robot's
    // gearbox is constructed, you might have to invert the left side instead.
    m_rightDrive.setInverted(true);
  }

  /** This function is run once each time the robot enters autonomous mode. */
  @Override
  public void autonomousInit() {
    m_timer.restart();
  }

  /** This function is called periodically during autonomous. */
  @Override
  public void autonomousPeriodic() {
    // Drive for 2 seconds
    if (m_timer.get() < 2.0) {
      // Drive forwards half speed, make sure to turn input squaring off
      m_robotDrive.arcadeDrive(0.5, 0.0, false);
    } else {
      m_robotDrive.stopMotor(); // stop robot
    }
  }

  /** This function is called once each time the robot enters teleoperated mode. */
  @Override
  public void teleopInit() {}

  /** This function is called periodically during teleoperated mode. */
  @Override
  public void teleopPeriodic() {
    m_robotDrive.arcadeDrive(-m_controller.getLeftY(), -m_controller.getRightX());
  }

  /** This function is called once each time the robot enters test mode. */
  @Override
  public void testInit() {}

  /** This function is called periodically during test mode. */
  @Override
  public void testPeriodic() {}
}
```

Now let's look at various parts of the code.

## Imports/Includes

```java
import edu.wpi.first.util.sendable.SendableRegistry;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.Timer;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.XboxController;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.drive.DifferentialDrive;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.motorcontrol.PWMSparkMax;
```

Our code needs to reference the components of WPILib that are used. In C++ this is accomplished using `#include` statements; in Java and Python it is done with `import` statements. The program references classes for XBoxController (for driving), PWMSparkMax / TalonFX / CANSparkMax / WPI_TalonSRX (for controlling motors), TimedRobot (the base class used for the example), Timer (used for autonomous), and DifferentialDrive (for connecting the Xbox controller to the motors).

## Defining the variables for our sample robot

```java
public class Robot extends TimedRobot {
  private final PWMSparkMax m_leftDrive = new PWMSparkMax(0);
  private final PWMSparkMax m_rightDrive = new PWMSparkMax(1);
  private final DifferentialDrive m_robotDrive =
      new DifferentialDrive(m_leftDrive::set, m_rightDrive::set);
  private final XboxController m_controller = new XboxController(0);
  private final Timer m_timer = new Timer();
```

The sample robot in our examples will have an Xbox Controller on USB port 0 for arcade drive and two motors on PWM ports 0 and 1 (Vendor examples use CAN with IDs 1 and 2). Here we create objects of type DifferentialDrive (`m_robotDrive`), XboxController (`m_controller`) and Timer (`m_timer`). This section of the code does three things:

1. Defines the variables as members of our Robot class.
2. Initializes the variables.

## Robot Initialization

```java
  /** Called once at the beginning of the robot program. */
  public Robot() {
    // We need to invert one side of the drivetrain so that positive voltages
    // result in both sides moving forward. Depending on how your robot's
    // gearbox is constructed, you might have to invert the left side instead.
    m_rightDrive.setInverted(true);
  }
```

The Robot constructor for our sample program inverts the right side of the drivetrain. Depending on your drive setup, you might need to invert the left side instead.

## Simple Autonomous Example

```java
  /** This function is run once each time the robot enters autonomous mode. */
  @Override
  public void autonomousInit() {
    m_timer.restart();
  }

  /** This function is called periodically during autonomous. */
  @Override
  public void autonomousPeriodic() {
    // Drive for 2 seconds
    if (m_timer.get() < 2.0) {
      // Drive forwards half speed, make sure to turn input squaring off
      m_robotDrive.arcadeDrive(0.5, 0.0, false);
    } else {
      m_robotDrive.stopMotor(); // stop robot
    }
  }
```

The `AutonomousInit` method is run once each time the robot transitions to autonomous from another mode. In this program, we restart the Timer in this method.

`AutonomousPeriodic` is run once every period while the robot is in autonomous mode. In the TimedRobot class the period is a fixed time, which defaults to 20ms. In this example, the periodic code checks if the timer is less than 2 seconds and if so, drives forward at half speed using the ArcadeDrive method of the DifferentialDrive class. If more than 2 seconds has elapsed, the code stops the robot drive.

## Joystick Control for Teleoperation

```java
  /** This function is called once each time the robot enters teleoperated mode. */
  @Override
  public void teleopInit() {}

  /** This function is called periodically during teleoperated mode. */
  @Override
  public void teleopPeriodic() {
    m_robotDrive.arcadeDrive(-m_controller.getLeftY(), -m_controller.getRightX());
  }
```

Like in Autonomous, the Teleop mode has a `TeleopInit` and `TeleopPeriodic` function. In this example we don't have anything to do in `TeleopInit`, it is provided for illustration purposes only. In `TeleopPeriodic`, the code uses the ArcadeDrive method to map the Y-axis of the left thumbstick of the XBoxController to forward/back motion of the drive motors and the X-axis to turning motion.

## Test Mode

```java
  /** This function is called once each time the robot enters test mode. */
  @Override
  public void testInit() {}

  /** This function is called periodically during test mode. */
  @Override
  public void testPeriodic() {}
}
```

Test Mode is used for testing robot functionality. Similar to `TeleopInit`, the `TestInit` and `TestPeriodic` methods are provided here for illustrative purposes only.
