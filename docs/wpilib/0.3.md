# 0.3. Creating a WPILib Project

To create a WPILib project, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open the Command Palette

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Command+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the Visual Studio Code command palette. Type “WPILib” into the prompt. This will display a list of WPILib-specific commands. Select the **Create a new project** command.

### Elements of the New Project Creator

1. **Project Type**: Choose the type of project to create.
2. **Language**: Select the programming language for the project (C++ or Java).
3. **Project Base**: Select the base class or example to generate the project from.
4. **Base Folder**: Specify the folder where the robot project will be located.
5. **Project Name**: Enter the name of the robot project. If the **Create a New Folder** option is checked, this name will also be used for the project folder.
6. **Create a New Folder**: Check this box to create a new folder for the project within the specified base folder. If unchecked, the project will be placed directly in the base folder. Note: An error will occur if the folder is not empty and this option is unchecked.
7. **Team Number**: Enter your team number. This will be used for package names within the project and to locate the robot during code deployment.
8. **Enable Desktop Support**: Check this box to enable unit testing and simulation. Note that while WPILib supports this, third-party libraries may not. Leave this unchecked unless you need unit testing or simulation and all libraries support it.

Once all fields are configured, click **Generate Project** to create the robot project.

## Step 3: Open the Project

After the project is created, Visual Studio Code will prompt you to open the project:

You can open the project immediately or later by pressing `Ctrl+K` followed by `Ctrl+O` (or `Command+O` on macOS) and selecting the folder where the project was saved.

Click **Yes, I trust the authors** when prompted.

## Step 4: Explore the Project

Once the project is opened, the project hierarchy will appear in the Explorer pane on the left. Double-click any file to open it in the editor.
