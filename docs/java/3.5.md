# 3.5. Nested Control Structures

Nested control structures in Java allow you to use one control structure inside another. This is useful for solving problems that require multiple levels of decision-making or iteration.

## Nested `if` Statements

An `if` statement can be placed inside another `if` statement to handle multiple conditions.

### Syntax

```java
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
    }
}
```

### Example

```java
int age = 20;
boolean hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18) {
    if (hasLicense) {
        System.out.println("You can drive.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("You need a license to drive.");
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("You are too young to drive.");
}
```

### Key Points

- The inner `if` is evaluated only if the outer `if` condition is true.
- Proper indentation improves readability.

## Nested Loops

Loops can be nested to handle multi-dimensional data or perform repeated actions within repeated actions.

### Syntax

```java
for (initialization1; condition1; update1) {
    for (initialization2; condition2; update2) {
        // Code to execute for each iteration of the inner loop
    }
}
```

### Example

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j <= 2; j++) {
        System.out.println("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
    }
}
```

### Output

```
i = 1, j = 1
i = 1, j = 2
i = 2, j = 1
i = 2, j = 2
i = 3, j = 1
i = 3, j = 2
```

### Key Points

- The inner loop completes all its iterations for each iteration of the outer loop.
- Be cautious of infinite loops when nesting.

## Nested `switch` Statements

A `switch` statement can be nested inside another `switch` statement to handle more complex cases.

### Example

```java
int outerValue = 1;
int innerValue = 2;

switch (outerValue) {
    case 1:
        switch (innerValue) {
            case 1:
                System.out.println("Outer 1, Inner 1");
                break;
            case 2:
                System.out.println("Outer 1, Inner 2");
                break;
        }
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Outer 2");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Default case");
}
```

### Output

```
Outer 1, Inner 2
```

### Key Points

- Each `switch` must have its own `break` statements to avoid fall-through.
- Avoid deeply nested `switch` statements for better readability.

## Best Practices for Nested Control Structures

- **Readability**: Minimize nesting levels to avoid confusion.
- **Refactoring**: Break complex nested structures into smaller methods.
- **Indentation**: Use consistent indentation to enhance code clarity.
- **Avoid Over-Nesting**: Excessive nesting can make code harder to debug and maintain.

Nested control structures are powerful tools but should be used judiciously to maintain code clarity and simplicity.
