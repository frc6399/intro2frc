# 2.1 Basic Program Structure

## 2.1.1 Hello, World!

We will use the classic example to break down the structure.

```java
// 1. Class Declaration
public class HelloWorld {

    // 2. Main Method Declaration
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // 3. Statement
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
// 4. End of class
```

A basic Java program is a collection of one or more classes. One of these classes _must_ contain the `main` method, which is the entry point for the application.

## 2.1.2 Components

### A. Comments

To explain code for human readers. Comments are completely ignored by the Java compiler.

```java
// this is a single-line comment

/*
this is a multi-line comment
*/

/**
 * this is also a multi-line comment
 */
```

### B. Class Declaration

- Concept: Java is an object-oriented language. Everything must be inside a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.
- Syntax: `public class ClassName { ... }`
  - `public`: An access modifier meaning this class is accessible from anywhere. (We'll learn more about this later).
  - `class`: The keyword used to declare a class.
  - `HelloWorld`: The name of the class. This is an identifier you choose.
- Rules for Class Names:
  - Follow CamelCase convention (first letter of each word capitalized).
  - Must start with a letter, underscore `_`, or dollar sign `$`.
  - Cannot be a Java keyword (e.g., `class`, `public`, `static`).
- Crucial Rule: The filename must exactly match the public class name (including case-sensitivity) and have the `.java` extension. So, the class `HelloWorld` must be in a file named `HelloWorld.java`.

### C. The Main Method

- Purpose: The entry point of any standalone Java application. When you run a program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for this exact method to start executing your code.
- Breakdown of its parts:
  - `public`: The method is accessible from anywhere, allowing the JVM to call it.
  - `static`: This means the method belongs to the _class itself_, not to a specific _instance_ (object) of the class. This is necessary because the JVM needs to call it without creating an object first.
  - `void`: This is the return type. `void` means this method does not return any value.
  - `main`: The name of the method. This is fixed.
  - `(String[] args)`: This is the method's parameter—a list of inputs it can accept.
    - `String[]`: This signifies an array of `String` objects.
    - `args`: The name of the parameter (you can technically name this anything, but `args` is the universal convention).
    - This parameter is used to accept command-line arguments.

### D. The Method Body

- The curly braces `{ }` define the body of the class and the main method. All code and variables inside these braces belong to that block.
- Indentation: While not required by the compiler, proper indentation is crucial for readability and is a standard practice.

### E. Statement

- Purpose: This is an executable statement that performs an action—in this case, printing text to the standard output (usually the console).
- Breakdown:
  - `System`: A predefined class in Java that provides access to the system.
  - `out`: A static member field of the `System` class, representing the standard output stream.
  - `println()`: A _method_ of the `out` object. It prints the text passed to it and adds a new line at the end (`ln`).
  - `"Hello, World!"`: A String literal—a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
- The Semicolon (`;`): Every statement in Java must end with a semicolon. It acts like a period in English, marking the end of a command. Forgetting it is a common syntax error.

## 2.1.3 Compilation and Execution Flow

It's vital to understand what happens behind the scenes:

1.  Write: You write the source code in a `.java` file (e.g., `HelloWorld.java`).
2.  Compile: You run the Java compiler (`javac HelloWorld.java`). The compiler:
    - Checks the code for syntax errors.
    - If error-free, it translates the human-readable source code into bytecode (a platform-independent intermediate language).
    - This bytecode is saved in a new file with a `.class` extension (e.g., `HelloWorld.class`).
3.  Execute: You run the program using the Java Interpreter (`java HelloWorld`). The Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
    - Reads the `.class` file (the bytecode).
    - Interprets the bytecode and translates it into native machine instructions for your specific operating system.
    - Executes the instructions.

This two-step process ("Write Once, Run Anywhere") is the foundation of Java's platform independence.

## 2.1.4 Variations

- Without `public`: A class doesn't _have_ to be public. If there's no public class in a file, the filename can be anything.

  ```java
  class MyClass { // Not a public class
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("This works!");
      }
  }
  ```

  _File can be named `MyClass.java` or even `SomethingElse.java`._

- Command-Line Arguments (`args`): The `args` array can be used to pass information to your program when you start it.

  ```java
  public class Greeter {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0] + "!");
      }
  }
  ```

  _Run it with `java Greeter Alice`. It will output: `Hello, Alice!`_

- `print()` vs. `println()`: `System.out.print()` prints text _without_ adding a new line at the end.

## 2.1.5 Summary

| Component   | Example                        | Purpose                                                    |
| :---------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class       | `public class MyApp`           | A blueprint for objects. The basic unit of a Java program. |
| Main Method | `public static void main(...)` | The mandatory entry point for the JVM.                     |
| Statement   | `System.out.println(...);`     | A single executable command.                               |
| Block       | `{ ... }`                      | A group of zero or more statements.                        |
| Comment     | `// Explanation`               | Text ignored by the compiler, for documentation.           |
| Semicolon   | `;`                            | Mandatory terminator for a statement.                      |

The Golden Rule: Every Java application must have at least one class, and that class must contain a `main` method with the exact signature: `public static void main(String[] args)`.
