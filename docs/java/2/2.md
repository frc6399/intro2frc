# 2.2. Variables and Data Types

## Variables

A variable is a fundamental concept in any programming language. Think of it as a named container or a labeled box that holds a value, which can be changed during the execution of the program.

- **Purpose:** To store data in the computer's memory so that it can be used and manipulated later in the program.
- **Analogy:** A variable is like a mailbox. The variable's name is the address on the mailbox, and the data it holds is the mail inside. You can change the mail inside, but the address remains the same.

## Declaration and Initialization

Using a variable in Java is a two-step process (which can be combined).

1.  **Declaration:** This is where you tell the compiler the variable's name and the type of data it will hold. You reserve the "box" and label it.

    - Syntax: `dataType variableName;`
    - Example: `int age;` (Declares a variable named `age` that will hold an integer)

2.  **Initialization:** This is the first time you assign a value to the variable. You are putting a value into the "box".
    - Syntax: `variableName = value;`
    - Example: `age = 25;` (Puts the value `25` into the variable `age`)

You can also declare and initialize a variable in a single statement, which is the most common practice.

- Syntax: `dataType variableName = value;`
- Example: `int score = 100;`

## Identifiers

Rules for naming variables (identifiers) in Java are strict:

- Must begin with a letter (a-z, A-Z), underscore (\_), or a dollar sign ($).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
- Cannot be a Java keyword (e.g., `int`, `class`, `public`).
- Case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).

Conventions (not rules, but best practices for readable code):

- Use meaningful names (e.g., `userName` instead of `x`).
- Follow camelCase convention: start with a lowercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word (e.g., `firstName`, `totalStudentCount`).

## Primitive Data Types

Java has eight primitive data types, which are the basic building blocks for storing simple values. They are built into the language.

| Data Type | Size (bits) | Description              | Range                         | Example Literals                       |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `byte`    | 8           | Very small integer       | -128 to 127                   | `byte b = 100;`                        |
| `short`   | 16          | Small integer            | -32,768 to 32,767             | `short s = 5000;`                      |
| `int`     | 32          | Standard integer         | ~-2.1 billion to ~2.1 billion | `int i = 100000;`                      |
| `long`    | 64          | Large integer            | Very large                    | `long l = 1234567890L;` (Note the 'L') |
| `float`   | 32          | Single-precision decimal | ~6-7 decimal digits           | `float f = 3.14f;` (Note the 'f')      |
| `double`  | 64          | Double-precision decimal | ~15 decimal digits            | `double d = 3.1415926535;`             |
| `char`    | 16          | Single character         | Unicode character             | `char grade = 'A';` (Single quotes)    |
| `boolean` | ~1          | Logical value            | `true` or `false`             | `boolean isJavaFun = true;`            |

Key Points:

- For whole numbers, `int` is the most commonly used type. Use `long` only if the number is very large.
- For decimal numbers, `double` is the default and most common choice. Use `float` only if you need to save memory in large arrays.
- The `char` data type uses single quotes (`' '`), not double quotes.
- The `boolean` type can only be `true` or `false`; it is not a number (unlike in some other languages).

## Reference Data Types

Unlike primitive types, reference types do not store the actual data itself. Instead, they store a reference (like a memory address) to the location where the data is stored.

- **Examples:** Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces.
- **The `String` Class:** The most common reference type. It is used to store a sequence of characters (text).
  - Example: `String greeting = "Hello World";`
  - Note: String literals are enclosed in double quotes (`" "`).

Key Difference: Primitive types hold values. Reference types hold addresses of objects.

## Constants

A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is assigned. You create a constant using the `final` keyword.

- Syntax: `final dataType CONSTANT_NAME = value;`
- Example: `final double PI = 3.14159;`
- Convention: Constant names are written in UPPERCASE letters with underscores separating words (e.g., `MAX_SPEED`).

## Type Casting

Type casting is converting a value from one data type to another. There are two types:

1.  **Widening Casting (Implicit):** Happens automatically when converting a smaller type to a larger type. It is safe because there is no risk of data loss.

    - Example: `int myInt = 9; double myDouble = myInt; // int -> double`

2.  **Narrowing Casting (Explicit):** Must be done manually by the programmer. Converting a larger type to a smaller type risks data loss, so you must explicitly confirm the cast by placing the target type in parentheses before the value.
    - Syntax: `targetType variableName = (targetType) value;`
    - Example: `double myDouble = 9.78; int myInt = (int) myDouble; // double -> int (myInt becomes 9)`

## The `var` Keyword (Java 10+)

Since Java 10, you can use `var` to declare local variables. The compiler infers the variable's type from the initializer on the right-hand side.

- Example: `var message = "Hello";` // compiler infers `message` as `String`
- `var count = 10;` // compiler infers `count` as `int`
- Important: `var` can only be used for local variables inside methods when they are declared and initialized on the same line. The variable still has a strong type; it is not "dynamically typed".

## Example Code Snippet

```java
public class VariablesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Primitive Types
        int studentCount = 30;
        double averageScore = 85.5;
        char finalGrade = 'A';
        boolean isPassed = true;

        // Reference Type (String)
        String className = "Introduction to Java";

        // Constant
        final int MAX_CLASS_SIZE = 40;

        // Type Casting
        double price = 19.99;
        int discountedPrice = (int) price; // Explicit cast, value becomes 19

        // var keyword
        var instructor = "Dr. Smith"; // Inferred as String

        // Printing variables
        System.out.println("Class: " + className);
        System.out.println("Discounted Price: $" + discountedPrice);
    }
}
```
