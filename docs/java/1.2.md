# 1.2. Installing JDK

To develop Java applications, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK). Follow the steps below to install and configure the JDK on your system.

## Step 1: Download the JDK

1. Go to the [Oracle JDK Downloads page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Select the appropriate JDK version for your operating system and architecture (e.g., Windows x64, macOS, or Linux).
3. Download the installer file.

## Step 2: Install the JDK

1. Locate the downloaded installer file and run it.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.
3. Take note of the installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-XX`), as it will be needed later.

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

To ensure your system recognizes the JDK, you need to set up environment variables:

1. Open your system's environment variable settings:
   - **Windows**: Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Edit the shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`).
2. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Variable Name**: `JAVA_HOME`
   - **Variable Value**: The path to your JDK installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-XX`).
3. Update the `PATH` variable:
   - Append the `bin` directory inside the JDK folder to the `PATH` variable (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-XX\bin`).

## Step 4: Verify the Installation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
3. If the installation was successful, the terminal will display the installed JDK version.
