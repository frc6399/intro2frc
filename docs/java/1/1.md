# 1.1. Java History

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed with the principle of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning compiled Java code can run on any platform supporting Java without requiring recompilation. This cross-platform capability has been a cornerstone of Java's success.

## Key Milestones in Java History

- **1991**: James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton started the Java project, initially named "Oak."
- **1995**: Java 1.0 was officially released, introducing applets and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allowed Java programs to run on any platform.
- **1997**: Java 2 introduced significant updates, including the Swing library for graphical user interfaces and the division into Java Standard Edition (J2SE), Enterprise Edition (J2EE), and Micro Edition (J2ME).
- **2006**: Sun Microsystems made Java open source under the GNU General Public License (GPL), fostering broader community contributions.
- **2010**: Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, taking over Java's development and stewardship.
- **2017**: Java 9 introduced the module system (Project Jigsaw), improving scalability, maintainability, and modular application development.

## Why Learn Java?

Java continues to be one of the most widely used programming languages due to its versatility, reliability, and extensive ecosystem. It powers a broad range of applications, including:

- **Web Development**: Backend systems and enterprise-level applications.
- **Mobile Applications**: Especially Android development.
- **Enterprise Systems**: Robust solutions for large-scale businesses.
- **Embedded Devices**: Applications in IoT and hardware systems.

Understanding Java's history provides valuable context for its design principles and enduring relevance in modern software development. By learning Java, you gain access to a powerful toolset for building scalable, secure, and cross-platform applications.
