# 3.4 Break and Continue

In Java, `break` and `continue` are control flow statements that allow you to alter the normal flow of loops. They are particularly useful for managing iterations in `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

## The `break` Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When encountered, it immediately terminates the loop and transfers control to the statement following the loop.

### Syntax

```java
break;
```

### Example

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
```

In this example, the loop stops when `i` equals 5, and the numbers 1 through 4 are printed.

## The `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not terminate the loop but allows you to skip specific cases.

### Syntax:

```java
continue;
```

### Example:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

In this example, the loop skips even numbers and prints only odd numbers.

## Using `break` and `continue` in `while` Loops

### Example with `break`

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break; // Exit the loop when i equals 5
    }
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
```

### Example with `continue`

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    i++;
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue; // Skip even numbers
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

**Output:**

```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## Key Points

1. **`break`**: Use to exit a loop entirely.
2. **`continue`**: Use to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next.
3. **Readability**: Use these statements sparingly to maintain code clarity.
4. **Nested Loops**: In nested loops, `break` and `continue` affect only the innermost loop.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Infinite Loops**: Ensure `break` or `continue` does not cause unintended infinite loops.
2. **Logic Errors**: Misusing `break` or `continue` can lead to unexpected behavior. Test thoroughly.

`break` and `continue` are powerful tools for controlling loop execution. Use them wisely to write efficient and readable code.
