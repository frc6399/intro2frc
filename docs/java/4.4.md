# 4.4. String Manipulation

This section focuses on the various techniques and methods used to manipulate strings in programming. String manipulation is a fundamental aspect of software development, as it allows developers to process, transform, and analyze textual data effectively. The key topics covered in this section include:

## Key Topics

### Concatenation

Combining multiple strings into one. For example:

```java
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // Output: "John Doe"
```

### Substring Extraction

Extracting specific portions of a string based on indices or patterns. For example:

```java
String text = "Hello, World!";
String sub = text.substring(7, 12); // Output: "World"
```

### Case Conversion

Changing the case of strings, such as converting to uppercase, lowercase, or title case. For example:

```java
String text = "Java Programming";
String upper = text.toUpperCase(); // Output: "JAVA PROGRAMMING"
String lower = text.toLowerCase(); // Output: "java programming"
```

### Trimming and Padding

Removing unnecessary whitespace or adding padding to strings to meet specific formatting requirements. For example:

```java
String text = "   Hello   ";
String trimmed = text.trim(); // Output: "Hello"
String padded = String.format("%-10s", "Hi"); // Output: "Hi        "
```

### Replacement and Substitution

Replacing specific characters or substrings within a string with new values. For example:

```java
String text = "apple";
String replaced = text.replace("a", "o"); // Output: "opple"
```

### Splitting and Joining

Dividing a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter or joining an array of strings into a single string. For example:

```java
String csv = "red,green,blue";
String[] colors = csv.split(",");
String joined = String.join("-", colors); // Output: "red-green-blue"
```

### Searching and Matching

Finding specific characters, substrings, or patterns within a string using methods or regular expressions. For example:

```java
String text = "Find the needle in the haystack.";
boolean contains = text.contains("needle"); // Output: true
```

### Reversing Strings

Reversing the order of characters in a string. For example:

```java
String text = "abc";
String reversed = new StringBuilder(text).reverse().toString(); // Output: "cba"
```

### Encoding and Decoding

Converting strings to different formats, such as Base64 or URL encoding, and decoding them back to their original form. For example:

```java
import java.util.Base64;

String original = "Hello";
String encoded = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(original.getBytes()); // Output: "SGVsbG8="
String decoded = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encoded)); // Output: "Hello"
```

## Best Practices

- Always validate and sanitize input strings to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Use built-in string manipulation methods for better performance and readability.
- Be cautious of memory usage when working with large strings or performing frequent manipulations.

This section provides examples and explanations for each of these operations, demonstrating how to use built-in string manipulation functions and libraries effectively. It also highlights best practices and common pitfalls to avoid when working with strings in various programming languages.
